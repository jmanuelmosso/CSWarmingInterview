 P R O B L E M
 A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
 
 A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
 
 For example, array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2
 is a permutation, but array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.
 
 The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
 
 Write a function:
 
 int solution(NSMutableArray *A);
 that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
 
 For example, given array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2
 the function should return 1.
 
 Given array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 the function should return 0.
 
 Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 
 N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

	// STEP 1
	//       Check for edge cases - when the array is empty [], we should return 0
	// STEP 2
	//		Generate NSSet from the Array in oder to eliminate possible duplicates
	//		NSSet also has better performance on search elements
	// STEP 3
	//		Implement a loop taking in consideration:
	//			So, to be a permutation, in the Array we MUST have N => (1,2,3...n)
	//			they don't need to be necessary ordered, but should conntain all the elemements from 1 to n
	//
	// STEP 4
	//		Look for the current target in the SET
	//		If the target does't exist, that means  is not a permutation
	//		Break the loop.
