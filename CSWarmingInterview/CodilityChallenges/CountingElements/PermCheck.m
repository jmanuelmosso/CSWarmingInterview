 P R O B L E M
 A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
 
 A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
 
 For example, array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2
 is a permutation, but array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.
 
 The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
 
 Write a function:
 
 int solution(NSMutableArray *A);
 that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
 
 For example, given array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 A[3] = 2
 the function should return 1.
 
 Given array A such that:
 
 A[0] = 4
 A[1] = 1
 A[2] = 3
 the function should return 0.
 
 Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 
 N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
